        <p>I was born and raised in Tegucigalpa, Honduras and now reside in Overland Park, Kansas. When I was not glued
            to a computer screen, I spent time drawing/ illustrating and chasing after my two young daughters Audrey 8
            and Grey 3. I also have a 21 year old daughter, Valerie. My passion for creating also led to small t-shirt
            business called Audrilla Studios.</p>

        <br>

        <p>I currently work at GOT systems ( a grocery inventory software company), gaining experience on the client
            management end, while I completes my certification as a web developer through The University of Kansas.</p>

        <br>


        <p>While working for the company Sulavisión, a cable channel in my native Honduras and MOB Productions ( a small
            Private Production company); I gained experience as a graphic animator/editor and realized that I have a
            passion for the technical and design areas.</p>
